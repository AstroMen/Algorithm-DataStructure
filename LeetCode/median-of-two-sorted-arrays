/********************************************************************************** 
* 
* There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
*
* Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
* 
* Example 1:
* nums1 = [1, 3]
* nums2 = [2]
* The median is 2.0
* 
* Example 2:
* nums1 = [1, 2]
* nums2 = [3, 4]
* The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
*
